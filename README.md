# Flow-Based Domain Tutorial with PyPowSyBl

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build and visualize a simplified Flow-Based domain using [PyPowSyBl](https://github.com/powsybl/pypowsybl).  
You will go from **power flow calculations** to **PTDFs** and **RAM constraints**, and finally visualize the Flow-Based domain.
