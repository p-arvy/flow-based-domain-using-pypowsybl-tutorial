    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow‑Based (FB) capacity calculation is the methodology TSOs use in Europe’s Core region to allocate cross‑border transmission capacity while respecting network security. It relies on **linear DC sensitivities**, **critical network elements with contingencies (CNECs)**, **Generation Shift Keys (GSKs)**, and **security margins** to bound the admissible net positions of bidding zones. The key elements listed above are introduced progressively throughout the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook goals\n",
    "This tutorial is a practical workspace to compute and visualize Flow‑Based domains with PyPowSyBl. We will:\n",
    "1. Introduce PyPowSyBl’s core features (network model, visualization, and load‑flow).\n",
    "2. Build a **toy multi‑zone network** and run a **zonal DC sensitivity analysis** (a prerequisite for FB).\n",
    "3. Construct and visualize the **FB domain** for selected zones.\n",
    "4. Study how FB **parameters** (CNEs, FRM, contingencies) impact the domain’s shape.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow-based capacity calculation is the method used for computation of cross-borders capacities in the Core region. This method determines, for each market zone, the maximum possible cross-border exchange capacities while simultaneously accounting for the physical constraints of the power grid (power flows and security margins) to ensure safe and efficient trading. \n",
    "\n",
    "These maximum exchange capacities are represented by a secure domain in the space of net positions $np_z$, each corresponding to the difference between the power exported and imported by zone $z$. The following figure illustrates an example of a commercial exchange space in a toy network that will be detailed later in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/3D_fb_domain.png\" alt=\"title\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dimension corresponds to the range of possible commercial exchanges for a specific hub (i.e., a bidding zone or a virtual hub created for modelling purposes). In the following, we will only refer to bidding zones, or zones, denoted by the set $ZONES$. It is within the boundaries of this domain that EUPHEMIA (the Pan-European Hybrid Electricity Market Integration Algorithm) seeks the optimum of European social welfare. The steps to compute this domain, called the Flow-Based domain, within the Core region are documented [here](https://www.entsoe.eu/bites/ccr-core/day-ahead/). \n",

    "In the remainder of this tutorial, we focus exclusively on constructing a Flow-Based domain with PyPowSyBl and on its visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow-Based domain\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $CNECs$ denote the set of critical network elements for a contingency, defining the Flow-Based domain. With $PTDF_{z,c}$ denoting the impact in terms of flow of zone $z$ on CNEC $c$, and $RAM_c$ the remaining available margin of CNEC $c$, the equations defining the domain are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{z\\in ZONES} PTDF_{z,c} np_z \\leq RAM_c \\qquad \\forall c \\in CNECs \\qquad (1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{z\\in ZONES} np_z = 0 \\qquad (2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation $(1)$ ensures that each CNEC of the network is not congested for any possible commercial exchange. Equation $(2)$ ensures that the Flow-Based domain describes sets of net positions that make sense from a modelling perspective: the sum of the net positions of all zones must be zero (what is exported must be imported somewhere else within the Flow-Based area). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Flow-Based domain is therefore the intersection of a polyhedron (or polytope), arising from constraints $(1)$, and a hyperplane (equation $(2)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous domain comes from a toy network studied in [(Felten et al., 2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957178720301302). To visualize its Flow-Based domain, we must first build this network with PyPowSyBl. The next section is dedicated to this.\n"

The PTDFs used in the Flow-Based domain equations (see [Flow-Based domain](#flow-based-domain)) are zonal PTDFs, i.e., mapping the variation of injection in zone $z$ to the flows on the different CNECs.\n",
